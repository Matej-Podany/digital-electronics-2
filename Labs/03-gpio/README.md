### Preparation

#include <avr/io.h>

```c
// Function declaration (prototype)
uint16_t calculate(uint8_t, uint8_t);

int main(void)
{
    uint8_t a = 156;
    uint8_t b = 14;
    uint16_t c;

    // Function call
    c = calculate(a, b);

    while (1)
    {
    }
    return 0;
}

// Function definition (body)
int calculate(uint8_t x, uint8_t y)
{
    uint16_t result;    // result = x^2 + 2xy + y^2
    result = x*x + 2*x*y + y*y;
    return result;
}
```
### Data types in C

1. Complete table.

| **Data type** | **Number of bits** | **Range** | **Description** |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-- | 
| `uint8_t`  | 8 | 0 to 255 | Unsigned 8-bit integer |
| `int8_t`   | 8 | -128 to 127 | Signed 8-bit integer |
| `uint16_t` | 16 | 0 to 65535 | Unsigned 16-bit integer |
| `int16_t`  | 16 | -62768 to 62767 | Signed 16-bit integer |
| `float`    | 32 | -3.4e+38, ..., 3.4e+38 | Single-precision floating-point |
| `void`     | 0 or 8 | none | Empty variable or void pointer |


### GPIO library

1. In your words, describe the difference between the declaration and the definition of the function in C.
   * Function declaration
   * Function definition

2. Part of the C code listing with syntax highlighting, which toggles LEDs only if push button is pressed. Otherwise, the value of the LEDs does not change. Use function from your GPIO library. Let the push button is connected to port D:

```c
    // Configure Push button at port D and enable internal pull-up resistor
    // WRITE YOUR CODE HERE

    // Infinite loop
    while (1)
    {
        // Pause several milliseconds
        _delay_ms(BLINK_DELAY);

        // WRITE YOUR CODE HERE
    }
```


### Traffic light

1. Scheme of traffic light application with one red/yellow/green light for cars and one red/green light for pedestrians. Connect AVR device, LEDs, resistors, one push button (for pedestrians), and supply voltage. The image can be drawn on a computer or by hand. Always name all components and their values!
